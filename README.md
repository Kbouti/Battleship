Battleship project for Odin:
https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship

To manually place your ships at the start of a game: 
  -click on a ship to select it, then hit an arrow key to move the ship in that direction. 
  -You will have to select the ship again after each time it is moved. 
  -To toggle the orientation of the ship select it and press the "shift" key. The ship needs to have space to toggle orientation while keeping the same starting square(left, topmost square). 

On your turn, click a square in the topmost gameboard to strike. A red circle indicates a hit, white indicates a miss. Sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours to win. 

This project fulfills the requirements for the assignment, but has room for emprovement: 
  -I didn't actually write the logic for a player vs player mode yet, so the game can only be played against a computer. If you try to submit the form to play player vs player it won't start a game or return you to the menu. You'll have to refresh the page. 
  -The method of moving the ships on the board is tedious, but it works. Ideally the ship would stay selected after moving once but I couldn't get that to work at the time. 
  -There's no button to restart the game on completion, just refresh the page when the game is done. 
  -The CSS could use much improvement, the ships aren't perfectly centered in their spaces.
